# 🎡 TIG Generator

> A chaotic roulette of fortune (or misfortune) created in 24 hours of anarchic coding at 42 School

## 🎲 What is this?

TIG Generator is a web-based roulette game that started as a simple reward/punishment system and evolved into a labyrinth of puzzles and secrets. Created during a caffeine-fueled coding sprint at 42 School, this project embodies the school's spirit of creative problem-solving and hidden complexity.

## 🎯 Core Features

- **42 Intranet Authentication**: Login using 42's OAuth system
- **Wheel of Fortune/Misfortune**: Spin to win rewards or face the music
- **Punishments**: Various school maintenance tasks (keyboard cleaning, monitor duty, etc.)
- **Rewards**: Mystery prizes for the lucky ones

## 🕵️‍♂️ The Rabbit Hole

But wait... there's more. Much more. Hidden beneath the surface lies a complex scavenger hunt with multiple layers of puzzles:

- 🔍 Steganographic messages in images
- 🧠 Brainfuck encoded secrets
- 🔐 ROT13 ciphers
- 📜 Ancient encryption techniques
- 🎯 Hidden HTML elements
- 💻 Source code treasures
- ...and many more undiscovered secrets

## 🚀 Can You Find Them All?

The true challenge isn't spinning the wheel - it's discovering all the hidden routes and solving the meta-puzzle. Some say there are still undiscovered secrets in the code...

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project was created in 24 hours of pure chaos. The code might be messy, but that's part of its charm. Some features may or may not have been added while sleep-deprived. Also, lot of routes disappeared and were not archived because the website was constantly evolving.
